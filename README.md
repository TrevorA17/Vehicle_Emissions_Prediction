# Vehicle Emissions Prediction
Welcome to CO2 Emission Prediction in R! This project is dedicated to predicting CO2 emissions from vehicles using machine learning techniques in R. Our aim is to develop accurate models that can forecast CO2 emissions based on various vehicle attributes such as engine size, cylinders, fuel type, city and highway MPG, among others. We have leveraged popular R libraries such as caret, randomForest, and plumber for model development, evaluation, and deployment. Throughout the project, we have emphasized data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure robust and reliable predictions. In this repository, you'll find the R scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, as well as a plumber API endpoint for accessing the trained model. We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the project further and make meaningful strides in CO2 emission prediction. Thank you for your interest in our project, and we hope it proves valuable for environmental research, policy-making, and sustainability efforts.
